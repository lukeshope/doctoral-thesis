abstract = {This paper develops and tests a sub-grid-scale wetting and drying correction for use with two-dimensional diffusion-wave models of urban flood inundation. The method recognizes explicitly that representations of sub-grid-scale topography using roughness parameters will provide an inadequate representation of the effects of structural elements on the floodplain (e.g. buildings, walls), as such elements not only act as momentum sinks, but also have mass blockage effects. The latter may dominate, especially in structurally complex urban areas. The approach developed uses high-resolution topographic data to develop explicit parameterization of sub-grid-scale topographic variability to represent both the volume of a grid cell that can be occupied by the flow and the effect of that variability upon the timing and direction of the lateral fluxes. This approach is found to give significantly better prediction of fluvial flood inundation in urban areas than traditional calibration of sub-grid-scale effects using Manning's n. In particular, it simultaneously reduces the need to use exceptionally high values of n to represent the effects of using a coarser mesh process representation and increases the sensitivity of model predictions to variation in n.},

abstract = {High resolution airborne laser data provide new ways to explore the role of topographic complexity in hy- draulic modelling parameterisation, taking into account the scale-dependency between roughness and topography. In this paper, a complex topography from LiDAR is processed using a spatially and temporally distributed method at a fine reso- lution. The surface topographic parameterisation considers the sub-grid LiDAR data points above and below a reference DEM, hereafter named as topographic content. A method for roughness parameterisation is developed based on the topo- graphic content included in the topographic DEM. Five sub- scale parameterisation schemes are generated (topographic contents at 0, $\backslash$pm 5, $\backslash$pm 10, $\backslash$pm 25 and $\backslash$pm 50 cm) and roughness values are calculated using an equation based on the mix- ing layer theory (Katul et al., 2002), resulting in a co-varied relationship between roughness height and topographic con- tent. Variations in simulated flow across spatial subscales show that the sub grid-scale behaviour of the 2-D model is not well-reflected in the topographic content of the DEM and that subscale parameterisation must be modelled through a spatially distributed roughness parameterisation. Variations in flow predictions are related to variations in the roughness parameter. Flow depth-derived results do not change sys- tematically with variation in roughness height or topographic content but they respond to their interaction. Finally, sub- scale parameterisation modifies primarily the spatial struc- ture (level of organisation) of simulated 2-D flow linearly with the additional complexity of subscale parameterisation.},

abstract = {The latest information and communications technology has enabled flood modelling in urban areas using high quality terrain data to simulate the detailed flow dynamics in local areas. However, the computational cost rises exponentially as the resolution goes finer. The advance of computing hardware is still a limiting factor for large-scale area or risk/uncertainty analysis modelling with fine resolution that describes the details of building features. Grid coarsening is the straightforward way to reduce the computing efforts for 2D flood modelling. The traditional approach to grid coarsening usually takes the average elevation of a fine grid as the new terrain model for the coarse grid. This approach often results in loss of information that introduces errors to modelling. In this study, the building features in coarse grids were abstracted using the building coverage ratio (BCR) and the conveyance reduction factor (CRF) parameters in a 2D model to simulate flooding in urban areas. The outcome of 2D case studies showed the proposed model can minimise the errors due to terrain averaging and provide a much better accuracy of modelling results at a marginally increased computing cost. ?? 2012 .},

abstract = {This paper describes benchmark testing of a diffusive and an inertial formulation of the de St. Venant equations implemented within the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model using high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data. The models are applied to a hypothetical flooding scenario in a section of Alcester, UK which experienced significant surface water flooding in the June and July floods of 2007 in the UK. The sensitivity of water elevation and velocity simulations to model formulation and grid resolution are analyzed. The differences in depth and velocity estimates between the diffusive and inertial approximations are within 10{\%} of the simulated value but inertial effects persist at the wetting front in steep catchments. Both models portray a similar scale dependency between 50. cm and 5. m resolution which reiterates previous findings that errors in coarse scale topographic data sets are significantly larger than differences between numerical approximations. In particular, these results confirm the need to distinctly represent the camber and curbs of roads in the numerical grid when simulating surface water flooding events. Furthermore, although water depth estimates at grid scales coarser than 1. m appear robust, velocity estimates at these scales seem to be inconsistent compared to the 50. cm benchmark. The inertial formulation is shown to reduce computational cost by up to three orders of magnitude at high resolutions thus making simulations at this scale viable in practice compared to diffusive models. For the first time, this paper highlights the utility of high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data to inform small-scale flood risk management studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Although existing hydraulic models have been used to simulate and predict urban flooding, most of these models are inadequate due to the high spatial resolution required to simulate flows in urban floodplains. Nesting high-resolution subdomains within coarser-resolution models is an efficient solution for enabling simultaneous calculation of flooding due to tides, surges, and high river flows. MSN{\_}Flood has been developed to incorporate moving boundaries around nested domains, permitting alternate flooding and drying along the boundary and in the interior of the domain. Ghost cells adjacent to open boundary cells convert open boundaries, in effect, into internal boundaries. The moving boundary may be multi-segmented and non-continuous, with recirculating flow across the boundary. When combined with a bespoke adaptive interpolation scheme, this approach facilitates a dynamic internal boundary. Based on an alternating-direction semi-implicit finite difference scheme, MSN{\_}Flood was used to hindcast a major flood event in Cork City resulting from the combined pressures of fluvial, tidal, and storm surge processes. The results show that the model is computationally efficient, as the 2-m high-resolution nest is used only in the urban flooded region. Elsewhere, lower-resolution nests are used. The results also show that the model is highly accurate when compared with measured data. The model is capable of incorporating nested sub-domains when the nested boundary is multi-segmented and highly complex with lateral gradients of elevation and velocities. This is a major benefit when modelling urban floodplains at very high resolution.},

This paper critiques the UK's National Flood Risk Assessment (NAFRA), its development for England and Wales over a decade, and its evaluation of economic fluvial and coastal flood risk. We find, when comparing the results with other data on flooding and the damage caused over 20 + years (including insurance claims), that NAFRA appears to overestimate the economic risk by between four- and five-fold (i.e. at c.{\pounds}1.1bn p.a., as opposed to a central estimate here of {\pounds}0.25bn p.a.). The flood problem faced is still serious, and may be increasing, but we suggest that an exaggeration has become embedded. The assessment models and their data need further enhancement if this situation is to be corrected and a realistic assessment made of the scale of the current fluvial and coastal flood risk.

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models, simulating the terrestrial water cycle on continental and global scales, are fundamental for many studies in earth system sciences. However, due to imperfect knowledge of real world systems, the models cannot be expected to capture all aspects of large-scale hydrology equally well. To gain insights in the strengths and shortcomings of nine large-scale hydrological models, we assessed their ability to capture the mean annual runoff cycle. Unlike most other studies that rely on discharge observations from continental scale river basins, our study is based on observed runoff from a large number of small, near-natural catchments in Europe. We evaluated the models' ability to capture the average magnitude, the amplitude, as well as the timing of the mean annual runoff cycle. Our study revealed large uncertainties when modeling runoff from these small catchments. We identified large differences in model performance, however, the ensemble mean (mean of all model simulations) yielded rather robust predictions. Model performance varied systematically with climatic conditions and was best in regions with little influence of snow. In cold regions, many models exhibited low correlations between observed and simulated mean annual cycles, which can be associated with shortcomings in simulating the timing of snow accumulation and melt. Local (grid cell) scale differences between observed and simulated runoff can be large and local biases often exceeded 100{\%}. These local uncertainties are contrasted by a relatively good regional average performance, ultimately reflecting the purpose of the models, i.e., to capture regional hydroclimatology.},

The discussion then addresses related themes of the division and preprocessing of data for model calibration/validation; data standardization techniques; and methods of evaluating ANN model performance. A literature survey underlines the need for clear guidance in current modelling practice, as well as the comparison of ANN methods with more conventional statistical models. Accordingly, a template is proposed in order to assist the construction of future ANN rainfall-runoff models. Finally, it is suggested that research might focus on the extraction of hydrological ‘rules' from ANN weights, and on the development of standard performance measures that penalize unnecessary model complexity.},

We review the theoretical basis for modelling floodplain flow with simplified hydraulic treatments based on a dimensional analysis of the one-dimensional shallow water equations. We then review how such schemes can be applied in practice and consider issues of space discretization, time discretization and model parameterisation, before going on to consider model assessment procedures. We show that a key advantage of reduced complexity codes is that they force modellers to think about the minimum process representation necessary to predict particular quantities and act as a check on any tendency to reductionism. At the same time, however, the use (compared to standard hydraulic codes) of strong simplifying assumptions requires us to also address the question "how simple can a model be and still be physically realistic?" We show that by making explicit this debate about acceptable levels of abstraction, reduced complexity codes allow progress to be made in addressing a number of long-standing debates in hydraulics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To examine these effects, the model is applied to a hypothetical flooding scenario in Alcester, UK, which experienced surface water flooding during summer 2007. The sensitivities of simulated water depth, extent, arrival time and velocity to grid resolutions and different roughness conditions are analysed. The results indicate that increasing the terrain resolution from 1m to 10 cm significantly affects modelled water depth, extent, arrival time and velocity. This is because hydraulically relevant small scale topography that is accurately captured by the terrestrial LIDAR system, such as road cambers and street kerbs, is better represented on the higher resolution DEM. It is shown that altering surface friction values within a wide range has only a limited effect and is not sufficient to recover the results of the 10 cm simulation at 1m resolution. Alternating between a uniform composite surface friction value (n = 0.013) or a variable distributed value based on land use has a greater effect on flow velocities and arrival times than on water depths and inundation extent. We conclude that the use of extra detail inherent in terrestrial laser scanning data compared to airborne sensors will be advantageous for urban flood modelling related to surface water, risk analysis and planning for Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) to attenuate flow.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the optimum assimilation of high-resolution data into numerical models using the example of topographic data provision for flood inundation simulation. First, we explore problems with current assimilation methods in which numerical grids are generated independent of topography. These include possible loss of significant length scales of topographic information, poor representation of the original surface and data redundancy. These are resolved through the development of a processing chain consisting of: (i) assessment of significant length scales of variation in the input data sets; (ii) determination of significant points within the data set; (iii) translation of these into a conforming model discretization that preserves solution quality for a given numerical solver; and (iv) incorporation of otherwise redundant sub-grid data into the model in a computationally efficient manner. This processing chain is used to develop an optimal finite element discretization for a 12 km reach of the River Stour in Dorset, UK, for which a high-resolution topographic data set derived from airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) was available. For this reach, three simulations of a 1 in 4 year flood event were conducted: a control simulation with a mesh developed independent of topography, a simulation with a topographically optimum mesh, and a further simulation with the topographically optimum mesh incorporating the sub-grid topographic data within a correction algorithm for dynamic wetting and drying in fixed grid models. The topographically optimum model is shown to represent better the ‘raw' topographic data set and that differences between this surface and the control are hydraulically significant. Incorporation of sub-grid topographic data has a less marked impact than getting the explicit hydraulic calculation correct, but still leads to important differences in model behaviour. The paper highlights the need for better validation data capable of discriminating between these competing approaches and begins to indicate what the characteristics of such a data set should be. More generally, the techniques developed here should prove useful for any data set where the resolution exceeds that of the model in which it is to be used.},

abstract = {The Probability Distributed Model, or PDM, has evolved as a toolkit of model functions that together constitute a lumped rainfall-runoff model capable of representing a variety of catchment-scale hydrological behaviours. Runoff production is represented as a saturation excess runoff process controlled by the absorption capacity (of the canopy, surface and soil) whose variability within the catchment is characterised by a probability density function of chosen form. Soil drainage to groundwater is controlled by the water content in excess of a tension threshold, optionally inhibited by the water content of the receiving groundwater store. Alternatively, a proportional split of runoff to fast (surface storage) and slow (groundwater) pathways can be invoked with no explicit soil drainage function. Recursive solutions to the Horton-Izzard equation are provided for routing flows through these pathways, conveniently considered to yield the surface runoff and baseflow components of the total flow. An alternative routing function employs a transfer function that is discretely-coincident to a cascade of two linear reservoirs in series. For real-time flow forecasting applications, the PDM is complemented by updating methods based on error prediction and state-correction approaches. The PDM has been widely applied throughout the world, both for operational and design purposes. This experience has allowed the PDM to evolve to its current form as a practical toolkit for rainfall-runoff modelling and forecasting.},

abstract = {An important aspect of hydraulic flood modelling deals with representing topography of river and floodplain. Commonly, flood model applications are reported successful in topographically simple areas were topography only changes gradually and where topography is simulated by DEM's of relatively low resolution. Such DEM's are particular useful for flood simulation in rural areas, although important topographic features and properties are not simulated explicitly. In urban areas, however, features like roads, buildings, river banks and dykes have great effect on flow dynamics and flood propagation and as such must be accounted for in the model set-up. This is possible by means of high resolution input data that relates to the systems topography as well as to the identified features. By frequent urban floodings over the past decades, an urgent need is identified to improve and increase our modelling efforts and to address more explicitly the effect model input data has on the simulation results. Society demands accurate and detailed information on magnitude and likeliness of hazardous flood events for design of flood mitigation measures. This also is the case for the city of Tegucigalpa in Honduras that severely has been affected by floodings as caused by extreme rainfall events. For the study area, a DEM with grid size of 1.5 m. is generated from LIDAR data and served as a base line case for various flood simulations. In this study, this DEM is re-sampled and DEM's of resolutions up to 15 m. are created and serve as input to the flood simulations. By the re-sampling to courser grid elements, averaging across increasingly larger domains is realized and has resulted in an increased loss of detailed topographic properties that affect flood simulations. The original DEM is also used to extract buildings by using geomorphologic filters and other GIS operations. For the simulation, buildings are represented as solid, partially solid and hollow objects by varying the surface roughness value. The sensitivity analysis to DEM resolution revealed that topographic representation is critical and that model output is significantly affected by the resolution of the DEM.},

abstract = {The paper forms the first part of an introduction to the SHE, a physically-based, distributed, catchment modelling system produced jointly by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, the British Institute of Hydrology and SOGREAH (France) with the financial support of the Commission of the European Communities. The SHE developed from the perception that conventional rainfall/runoff models are inappropriate to many pressing hydrological problems, especially those related to the impact of man's activities on land-use change and water quality. Only through the use of models which have a physical basis and allow for spatial variations within a catchment can these problems be tackled. The physical basis and flexible operating structure of the SHE allows the model to use as many or as few data as are available and also to incorporate data on topography, vegetation and soil properties not normally included in catchment models. It does not require a lengthy hydrometeorological record for its calibration and its distributed nature enables the spatial variability in catchment inputs and outputs to be simulated. However, the large amount of data required by the model means that new operation methodologies must be evolved. Thus spatial scale effects or simply a lack of data may create significant uncertainties in the values of the catchment parameters used in a simulation. These uncertainties will give rise to corresponding uncertainties in the predictions. However, the SHE is able to quantify these uncertainties by carrying out sensitivity analyses for realistic ranges of the parameter values. Even when there is a lack of data, therefore, the SHE can act as a valuable "decision-support system". {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a two-layer Savage-Hutter type model that is the natural extension of the 1D system proposed by E. D. Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Nieto et al in 2008 to simulate tsunamis generated by landslides. We describe a single GPU and a multi-GPU implementation of this model using MPI and the CUDA framework over structured meshes. The distributed implementation is tested for several artificial and realistic problems using up to 24 GPUs. We also propose a static and a dynamic load balancing algorithm in order to deal with the unbalanced computational load due to different amount of wet and dry areas among the subdomains. The validity of the model is tested by simulating the tsunami occurred in Lituya Bay, Alaska, in 1958. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the multi-GPU solver, the usefulness of the load balancing algorithms and the validity of the model to simulate real tsunamis generated by landslides.},

abstract = {During a dam-break flow, the whole valley is involved, which implies that roads, bridges and urban buildings become obstacles to the flow. The purpose of this paper is to provide data about the influence of such an obstacle on a dam-break wave, the obstacle being an idealised representation of a single building. The experimental set-up consists in a channel with a rectangular shaped obstacle, representing a building, placed immediately downstream from the dam. The building is neither centred in the channel, nor aligned with the flow direction. Flow observation shows that after the violent impact of the wave on the building, the flow is forced to change its direction to pass the building. This implies the formation of hydraulic jumps with the consequence that the water level may rise locally higher than without building. Behind the building, a wake zone is observed. Then, further downstream, the flow slowly recovers the structure it would have had without the building. Several measurement devices were used to characterise the flow. At five different locations, the water level evolution was measured by means of water level gauges while the velocity was measured by means of an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. Then, the surface velocity field was obtained using digital imaging techniques.},

abstract = {A well-balanced Godunov-type finite volume algorithm is developed for modelling free-surface shallow flows over irregular topography with complex geometry. The algorithm is based on a new formulation of the classical shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Unstructured triangular grids are used to achieve the adaptability of the grid to the geometry of the problem and to facilitate localised refinement. The numerical fluxes are calculated using HLLC approximate Riemann solver, and the MUSCL-Hancock predictor-corrector scheme is adopted to achieve the second-order accuracy both in space and in time where the solutions are continuous, and to achieve high-resolution results where the solutions are discontinuous. The novelties of the algorithm include preserving well-balanced property without any additional correction terms and the wet/dry front treatments. The good performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing numerical and theoretical results of several benchmark problems, including the preservation of still water over a two-dimensional hump, the idealised dam-break flow over a frictionless flat rectangular channel, the circular dam-break, and the shock wave from oblique wall. Besides, two laboratory dam-break cases are used for model validation. Furthermore, a practical application related to dam-break flood wave propagation over highly irregular topography with complex geometry is presented. The results show that the algorithm can correctly account for free-surface shallow flows with respect to its effectiveness and robustness thus has bright application prospects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The finite volume Godunov-type flood model formulation is the most comprehensive amongst those currently employed for flood risk modeling. The local Discontinuous Galerkin method constitutes a more complex, rigorous, and extended local Godunov-type formulation. However, the practical merit associ- ated with such an increase in the level of complexity of the formulation is yet to be decided. This work makes the case for a second-order Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG2) formulation and contrasts it with the equivalently accurate finite volume (MUSCL) formulation, both of which solve the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) in two space dimensions. The numerical complexity of both formulations are presented and their capabilities are explored for wide-ranging diagnostic and real-scale tests, incorporating all chal- lenging features relevant to flood inundation modeling. Our findings reveal that the extra complexity asso- ciated with the RKDG2 model pays off by providing higher-quality solution behavior on very coarse meshes and improved velocity predictions. The practical implication of this is that improved accuracy for flood mod- eling simulations will result when terrain data are limited or of a low resolution.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a 2D unstructured finite volume Godunov-type shallow water model to simulate complex flows involving wet-dry interfaces over irregular terrains. In this model, the MUSCL linear reconstruction is used to compute the values of variables at cell edges. These values are then modified with a non-negative reconstruction method to preserve non-negative edge water depths and the C-property. The modified values are then employed to evaluate the fluxes and the slope source terms using the Harten, Lax and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC) and the slope flux method, respectively. The friction source terms are solved by a splitting point-implicit method. The novel aspect of the model is an efficient approach to eliminate spurious edge velocities with high local extreme values caused by MUSCL reconstruction of the conservative variables near wet-dry interfaces. This approach is crucial to preserve the numerical stability of the model when simulating wetting and drying. The proposed model is tested against exact solutions, laboratory experiments and a real dam-break case. The results show that the proposed model is accurate and stable for handling complex flows with moving wet-dry interfaces over complex beds on unstructured grids. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Regular grids are commonly used in 2D flood modelling due to wide availability of terrain models and low pre-processing required for input preparation. Despite advances in both computing software and hardware, high resolution flood modelling remains computationally demanding when applied to a large study area when the available time and resources are limited. Traditional grid coarsening approach may reduce not only the computing demands, but also the accuracy of results due to the loss of detailed information. To keep key features that affect flow propagation within coarse grid, the approach proposed and tested in this paper adopts multiple layers in flood modelling to reflect individual flow paths separated by buildings within a coarse grid cell. The cell in each layer has its own parameters (elevation, roughness, building coverage ratio, and conveyance reduction factors) to describe itself and the conditions at boundaries with neighbourhood cells. Results of tests on the synthetic case study and the real world urban area show that the proposed multi-layered approach greatly improves the accuracy of coarse grid modelling with an insignificant additional computing cost. The proposed approach has been tested in conjunction with the UIM model by taking the high resolution results as the benchmark. The implementation of the proposed multi-layered methodology to any regular grid based 2D model would be straightforward. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

This paper presents a shallow-water model with porosity to account for the reduction in storage and in the exchange sections due to presence of buildings and other structures on the floodplains. The introduction of the porosity in the shallow-water equations modifies the expressions for the fluxes and source terms. Furthermore, it implies the addition of a specific source term. The equations are solved by means of a finite-volume scheme with a modified HLLC Riemann solver and upwind treatment of the source terms. The possibilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated by an application to a large-scale experiment that was part of the European IMPACT project, which represents the severe flooding of the Italian Toce valley. This demonstrates the key advantage of the method, as it allows an accurate representation of the flow without detailed meshing of the urbanized area.},

abstract = {Modeling of dam-break flooding in an urban residential area in southern California is presented. Modeling is performed using BreZo, an unstructured grid, Godunov-type, finite volume model that solves the shallow-water equations. The model uses terrain data from a 1.5 m Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and contour data depicting the reservoir and breach geometry. A spatially distributed Manning coefficient based on a landcover classification derived from digital orthophotos and vector data (e.g., parcel outlines) is also used, and the interception of flow by storm drains is modeled with sink terms in the 2D continuity equation. The model is validated with flood extent and stream flow measurements, and a sensitivity analysis is completed to identify the necessary level of data and model complexity for accuracy purposes. Results show street depressions in the land surface should be resolved by the computational mesh for flood extent and stream flow accuracy. A ca. 5 m resolution mesh that spans streets by approximately 3 cells achieves a good balance between accuracy and computational effort. Results also show that heterogeneous resistance is important for stream flow accuracy, and the interception of overland flow by storm sewers is important for flood extent accuracy. The sensitivity of predictions to several additional factors such as the reservoir level, breach geometry and DTM source (LiDAR, National Elevation Data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Data) is also reported. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Computational time can be reduced by running a model in parallel over multiple cores. However, there are many parallelisation methods and these differ in terms of difficulty of implementation, suitability for particular codes and parallel efficiency. This study compares three parallelisation methods based on OpenMP, message passing and specialised accelerator cards. The parallel implementations of the codes were required to produce near identical results to a serial version for two urban inundation test cases. OpenMP was considered the easiest method to develop and produced similar speedups (of ???3.9??) to the message passing code on up to four cores for a fully wet domain. The message passing code was more efficient than OpenMP, and remained over 90{\%} efficient on up to 50 cores for a completely wet domain. All parallel codes were less efficient for a partially wet domain test case. The accelerator card code was faster and more power efficient than the standard code on a single core for a fully wet domain, but was subject to longer development time (2 months compared to {\textless}2 week for the other methods). ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, an alternative formulation is proposed based on a new depth-positivity-preserving condition to solve the zero-inertia governing equation. The new condition does not use a flux limiter and is practical for flood simulations with wetting and drying over complex domain topographies. Two time stepping methods are considered and studied along with the proposed numerical model. The first one is based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is widely used to control the time step for the explicit shallow water equation solvers; the second one is the adaptive time stepping (ATS) reported by Hunter et al. [1], which was specifically designed for a DWM. Numerical results and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) analysis show that the new model is able to provide stable and accurate solutions without the necessity for a flux limiter.

abstract = {Parametric-based, lumped watershed models have been widely employed for integrated surface and groundwater modelling to calculate surface runoff on various temporal and spatial scales of hydrologic regimes. Physics-based, process-level, distributed models that have the design capability to cover multimedia and multi-processes and are applicable to various scales have been practically nonexistent until late 1990s. It has long been recognized that only such models have the potential to further the understanding of the fundamental factors that take place in nature hydrologic regimes; to give mechanistic predictions; and most importantly to be able to couple and interact with weather/climate models. However, there are severe limitations with these models that inhibit their use. These are, among other things, the ad hoc approaches of coupling between various media, the simplification of modelling overland and/or river flow, and the excessive demand of computational time. This paper presents the development of an integrated media (river/stream networks, overland regime, and subsurface media), integrated processes (evaporation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, recharges, and flows) watershed model to address these issues. Rigorous coupling strategies are described for interactions among overland regime, rivers/streams/canals networks, and subsurface media. The necessities to include various options in modelling surface runoff and river hydraulics are emphasized. The options of selecting characteristic wave directions for two-dimensional problems are stated. The implementation of high performance computing to increase the computational speed is discussed. Four examples are used to demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the model as applied to a theoretical benchmark scale, a parallel computing, and two project-level large scale problems - one in Taiwan and the other in Florida. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) flood inundation modelling is now an important part of flood risk management practice. Research in the fields of computational hydraulics and numerical methods, allied with advances in computer technology and software design, have brought 2D models into mainstream use. Even so, the models are computationally demanding and can take a long time to run, especially for large areas and at high spatial resolutions (for instance 2 x 2 m or smaller grid cells). There is thus strong motivation to accelerate 2D model codes. This paper demonstrates the use of technology from the computer graphics industry to accelerate a 2D diffusion wave (non-inertial) floodplain model. Over the past decade the huge market for computer games has driven the development of very fast, relatively low-cost 'graphical processing units'. In recent years there has been a growing interest in this high-performance graphics hardware for scientific and engineering applications. This work adapted a flood model algorithm to run on a commodity personal computer graphics card. The results of a benchmark urban flood simulation were reproduced and the model run time reduced from 18 h to 9.5 min.},

abstract = {This article presents an overview and initial results of a geoweb analysis designed to provide the foundation for a continued discussion of the potential impacts of ‘big data' for the practice of critical human geography. While Haklay's (2012) observation that social media content is generated by a small number of ‘outliers' is correct, we explore alternative methods and conceptual frameworks that might allow for one to overcome the limitations of previous analyses of user-generated geographic information. Though more illustrative than explanatory, the results of our analysis suggest a cautious approach toward the use of the geoweb and big data that are as mindful of their shortcomings as their potential. More specifically, we propose five extensions to the typical practice of mapping georeferenced data that we call going ‘beyond the geotag': (1) going beyond social media that is explicitly geographic; (2) going beyond spatialities of the ‘here and now'; (3) going beyond the proximate; (4) going beyond the human to data produced by bots and automated systems, and (5) going beyond the geoweb itself, by leveraging these sources against ancillary data, such as news reports and census data. We see these extensions of existing methodologies as providing the potential for overcoming existing limitations on the analysis of the geoweb. The principal case study focuses on the widely reported riots following the University of Kentucky men's basketball team's victory in the 2012 NCAA championship and its manifestation within the geoweb. Drawing upon a database of archived Twitter activity – including all geotagged tweets since December 2011–we analyze the geography of tweets that used a specific hashtag ({\#}LexingtonPoliceScanner) in order to demonstrate the potential application of our methodological and conceptual program. By tracking the social, spatial, and temporal diffusion of this hashtag, we show how large databases of such spatially referenced internet content can be used in a more systematic way for critical social and spatial analysis.},

Our solver can be regarded as a relativistic extension of the five-wave HLLD Riemann solver initially developed by Miyoshi {\&} Kusano for the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The solution to the Riemann problem is approximated by a five-wave pattern, comprising two outermost fast shocks, two rotational discontinuities and a contact surface in the middle. The proposed scheme is considerably more elaborate than in the classical case since the normal velocity is no longer constant across the rotational modes. Still, proper closure to the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions can be attained by solving a non-linear scalar equation in the total pressure variable which, for the chosen configuration, has to be constant over the whole Riemann fan. The accuracy of the new Riemann solver is validated against one-dimensional tests and multidimensional applications. It is shown that our new solver considerably improves over the popular Harten-Lax-van Leer solver or the recently proposed HLLC schemes.},

abstract = {A smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical model for shallow water equations (SWEs) is presented for simulating flood inundation owing to rapidly varying flow, such as dam breaks, tsunamis, and levee breaches. Important theoretical and numerical developments have recently been made, and the model in this paper incorporates these developments and implements open boundary conditions, resulting in a general, accurate computational tool suitable for practical application. The method is attractive for flood simulation over large domains in which the extent of inundation is unknown because computation is carried out only in wet areas and is dynamically adaptive. The open boundary algorithm is very general, on the basis of a simplified version of the characteristics method, handling both supercritical and subcritical inflow and outflow. This is tested against reference solutions for flows over a hump involving shocks. The model is then applied to two very different flood inundations resulting from the Okushiri tsunami in Japan and from a hypothetical dyke breach at Thamesmead in the United Kingdom. The SPH-SWE model compares well with established commercial and state-of-the-art finite-volume codes.},

abstract = {Urban areas are vulnerable to major flood damages due to the density of economic and social assets, and there is increasing interest in localized flood intensity predictions to implement flood risk reduction measures. A number of models have been proposed for unsteady flood flows through urban landscapes, but the data needs and complexity are varied and it is not clear that the benefits of added complexity are justified by improved predictive skill. In this study we compare four methods to model unsteady, multi-dimensional flow through urban areas: building resistance (BR), building block (BB), building hole (BH) and building porosity (BP). Each method is applied to the Baldwin Hills, CA urban dam break scenario which offers excellent data for model parameterization, validation and overall performance assessment including observations of flood extent, stream flow, and scour path. Results show that all four methods are capable of high predictive skill for flood extent and stream flow using unique unstructured meshes tailored to exploit the strengths of each approach. However, localized velocities prove more difficult to predict and are sensitive to the building method even in the limit of a very fine grid (. ca. 1.5. m resolution). In addition, only those methods that account for building geometries (BB, BH and BP) capture building-scale variability in the velocity field. Tradeoffs between predictive skill, execution time, and set-up time are identified suggesting that the best method for a particular application will depend on available data, computing resources, time constraints, and the specific modeling objectives. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A code solving the 2D shallow water equations by an explicit second-order scheme is used to simulate the severe October 1988 flood in the Richelieu urban locality of the French city of N??mes. A reference calculation using a detailed description of the street network and of the cross-sections of the streets, considering impervious residence blocks and neglecting the flow interaction with the sewer network provides a mean peak water elevation 0.13 m lower than the measured flood marks with a standard deviation between the measured and computed water depths of 0.53 m. Sensitivity analysis of various topographical and numerical parameters shows that globally, the results keep the same level of accuracy, which reflects both the stability of the calculation method and the smoothening of results. However, the local flow modifications due to change of parameter values can drastically modify the local water depths, especially when the local flow regime is modified. Furthermore, the flow distribution to the downstream parts of the city can be altered depending on the set of parameters used. Finally, a second event, the 2002 flood, was simulated with the calibrated model providing results similar to 1988 flood calculation. Thus, the article shows that, after calibration, a 2D model can be used to help planning mitigation measures in a dense urban area. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods for data quality control and classification of precipitation types are first described. A super-dense network comprising eight gauges within a 2 km grid square is employed to obtain a "true value" of rainfall against which the 2 km radar grid and a single "typical gauge" estimate can be compared. Accuracy is assessed as a function of rainfall intensity, for different periods of time-integration (15 minutes, 1 hour and 1 day) and for two 8-gauge networks in areas of low and high relief In a similar way, the catchment gauge network is used to provide the "true catchment rainfall" and the accuracy of a radar estimate (an area-weighted average of radar pixel values) and a single "typical gauge" estimate of catchment rainfall evaluated as a function of rainfall intensity. A single gauge gives a standard error of estimate for rainfall in a 2 km square and over the catchment of 33{\%} and 65{\%} respectively, at rain rates of 4 mm in 15 minutes. Radar data at 2 km resolution give corresponding errors of 50{\%} and 55{\%}. This illustrates the benefit of using radar when estimating catchment scale rainfall.

In particular, the overland flow was considered as a 2D unsteady flow and was mathematically described using three approaches (fully dynamic, diffusive and kinematic waves). Numerical results highlighted that the differences among the simulations were not very important when the simulations referred to commonly used ideal tests found in the literature in which the topography is reduced to plane surface. Significant differences were observed in more complicated tests for which only the fully dynamic model was able to provide a good prediction of the observed discharges and water depths. Then, attention is focused on the fully dynamic model and in particular on the analysis of two numerical schemes (TVD-MacCormack and HLL) and the influence of the grid size. Numerical tests carried out on irregular topography show that, as the grid size decreases, the performance of the HLL scheme becomes closer to that of the TVD-MacCormack scheme in shorter computational times at least for high rainfall intensity.},

These regions can exchange mass and momentum based on water level difference. Street networks or alignments of buildings along preferential directions are accounted for by introducing anisotropic velocity distributions in some of the regions. Dead zones, storage yards in buildings and other stagnant areas are accounted for in the model. The mass and momentum exchange between the flow regions induce additional head loss terms. The proposed model can be formulated in differential form, thus making equation discretization method- and mesh-independent. Computational examples show that, although the representative elementary volume does not exist at the scale of an urban area, the proposed model can give reliable results compared to classical refined two-dimensional shallow water models, with a computational effort reduced by a factor 20-200 depending on the test case. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High-resolution data obtained from airborne remote sensing is increasing opportunities for representation of small-scale structural elements (e.g. walls, buildings) in complex floodplain systems using two-dimensional (2D) models of flood inundation. At the same time, 2D inundation models have been developed and shown to provide good predictions of flood inundation extent, with respect to both full solution of the depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and simplified diffusion-wave models. However, these models have yet to be applied extensively to urban areas. This paper applies a 2D raster-based diffusion-wave model to determine patterns of fluvial flood inundation in urban areas using high-resolution topographic data and explores the effects of spatial resolution upon estimated inundation extent and flow routing process. Model response shows that even relatively small changes in model resolution have considerable effects on the predicted inundation extent and the timing of flood inundation. Timing sensitivity would be expected, given the relatively poor representation of inertial processes in a diffusion-wave model. Sensitivity to inundation extent is more surprising, but is associated with: (1) the smoothing effect of mesh coarsening upon input topographical data; (2) poorer representation of both cell blockage and surface routing processes as the mesh is coarsened, where the flow routing is especially complex; and (3) the effects of (1) and (2) upon water levels and velocities, which in turn determine which parts of the floodplain the flow can actually travel to. It is shown that the combined effects of wetting and roughness parameters can compensate in part for a coarser mesh resolution. However, the coarser the resolution, the poorer the ability to control the inundation process, as these parameters not only affect the speed, but also the direction of wetting. Thus, high-resolution data will need to be coupled to a more sophisticated representation of the inundation process in order to obtain effective predictions of flood inundation extent. This is explored in a companion paper. Copyright 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Large geophysical flows often encompass both coarse and highly resolved regions. Approximating these flows using shock-capturing methods with explicit time stepping gives rise to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) time step constraint. Even if the refined regions are sparse, they can restrict the global CFL condition to very small time steps, vastly increasing computational effort over the whole domain. One method to cope with this problem is to use locally varying time steps over the domain. These are also referred to as multi-rate methods in the ODE literature. Ideally, such methods must be conservative, accurate and easy to implement. In this study, we derive a second-order, local time stepping procedure within a Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) framework to solve the shallow water equations. This procedure is based on previous first-order work of the second author and collaborator Kirby [1-3]. As we are interested in both coastal and overland flows due to, e.g., rainfall, wetting and drying is incorporated into the model. Numerical results are shown, which verify the accuracy and efficiency of the approach (compared to using a globally defined CFL time step), and the application of the method to rainfall-runoff scenarios. ?? 2012.},

A model urban district made up of concrete blocks has been placed in an instrumented physical model of a short reach of the Alpine Toce River to simulate the ﬂooding of a populated area. Water depth history at certain locations has been recorded for several conﬁgurations of the model city, the surrounding terrain and the intensity of the ﬂooding conditions. The urban district appears to the ﬂood as an obstruction leading to the formation of a strong hydraulic jump in front of the buildings. When the ﬂood wave enters the city a complex ﬂow pattern is established made up of oblique waves and reﬂections. The measurements can be readily used for validation of mathematical models of ﬂood propagation in urban areas.},

abstract = {Topographic data are increasingly available at high resolutions ({\textless}10m) over large spatial extents to support detailed flood inundation modeling and loss estimation analyses required for flood risk management. This paper describes ParBreZo, the parallel implementation of a two-dimensional, Godunov-type, shallow-water code, to address the computational demand of high-resolution flood modeling at the regional scale (102-104km2). A systematic approach to unstructured grid partitioning (domain decomposition) is presented, and the Single Process Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm of distributed-memory parallelism is implemented so the code can be executed on computer clusters with distributed memory, shared memory, or some combination of the two (now common with multi-core architectures). In a fully-wetted, load-balanced test problem, the code scales very well with a parallel efficiency of close to 100{\%} on up to 512 processes (maximum tested). A weighted grid partitioning is used to partially address the load balancing challenge posed by partially wetted domains germane to flooding applications, where the flood extent varies over time, while the partitioning remains static. An urban dam-break flood test problem shows that weighted partitions achieve a parallel efficiency exceeding 70{\%} using up to 48 processes. This corresponds to a 97{\%} reduction in execution time so results are obtained in a matter of minutes, which is attractive for routine engineering analyses. A hurricane storm surge test problem shows that a 10m resolution, 12h inundation forecast for a 40km length of coastline can be completed in under 2h using 512 processors. Hence, if coupled to a hurricane forecast system capable of resolving storm surge, inundation forecasts could be made at 10m resolution with at least a 10h lead time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many natural terrains have complicated surface topography. The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wet-dry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wet-dry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The SHLL method is a purely vector-split approximation of the classical HLL method [Harten, Lax and van Leer, 1983] which assumes the presence of local wave propagation in the algabraic derivation of fluxes across cell surfaces. The conventional HLL flux expression terms are interface-split and wave propagation velocities estimated (where required) based on local conditions. Due to the highly local nature of the SHLL fluxes, the scheme is very efficiently applied to GPU computation since the flux, initialisation and update phases of the computation are all vectorized processes. The SHLL scheme is applied to GPU computating using Nvidia's CUDA package. Numerical schemes are presented for solutions to the general transport (convection- diffusion) equation, Euler Equations and Shallow Water Equations with results presented for several benchmark gas and shallow water flow engineering problems.

For the Taum Sauk flood simulation, the GPU model speedup compared to an identical CPU model implementation is 80??-88?? for computational domains ranging from 65.5 k to 1.05 M cells. Thirty minutes of event time were simulated by the GPU model in 2 min, 15 times faster than real time. An important finding of the analysis of model domain size is the GPU model is not constrained by model domain extent as is the CPU model. Finally, the GPU implementation is shown to be scalable compared with the CPU version, an important characteristic for large domain flood modeling studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since 1962 storage cell codes have been developed to simulate flow on fluvial and coastal floodplains. These models treat the floodplain as a series of discrete storage cells, with the flow between cells calculated explicitly using some analytical flow formulae such as the Manning equation. Recently these codes have been reconfigured to use regular Cartesian grids to make full use of widely available high resolution data captured from remote sensing platforms and stored in a raster GIS format. Such raster-based storage cell codes have many of the advantages over full two-dimensional depth averaged schemes but without the computational cost, however their typical implementation results in a number of fundamental limitations. These include an inability to develop solutions that are independent of time step or grid size, and an unrealistic lack of sensitivity to floodplain friction. In this paper, we propose a new solution to these problems based on an optimal adaptive time step determined using the Courant-Freidrichs-Levy condition for model stability. Comparison of this new adaptive time step scheme to analytical solutions of wave propagation on flat and sloping planar surfaces shows considerable improvement over a standard raster storage cell model. Moreover, the new scheme is shown to yield results that are independent of grid size or choice of initial time step and which show an intuitively correct sensitivity to floodplain friction over spatially complex topography. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent research modelling floodplain inundation processes has concentrated on issues surrounding the level of physical, topographical, and numerical solver complexity needed to represent floodplain flows adequately. However, during flooding episodes the channel typically still conveys the bulk of the flow. Despite this, the effect of channel physical processes and topographic complexity on model results has been largely unexplored. To address this, the impact of channel cross-section geometry, channel long-profile variability and the representation of hydraulic structures on floodplain inundation are explored using a coupled dynamic 1D-2D hydraulic model (ESTRY-TUFLOW) of the Carlisle floods of January 2005. These simulations are compared with those from a simplified 1D-2D model, LISFLOOD-FP. In this case, the simpler model is sufficient to simulate the far-field peak flood elevations. However, comparison of channel dynamics suggests that the full shallow water approximation used by ESTRY-TUFLOW gives a more robust performance when models calibrated on maximum floodplain water elevations are used to predict channel water levels. Examination of the response of ESTRY-TUFLOW to variations in channel geometric complexity shows that downstream variations in the channel long profile are more important than cross-section variability for obtaining a dataset-independent calibration. The results show, in general, that as model physical complexity is increased, calibrated parameters become less 'effective', and as a consequence, the values of performance measures reduce less rapidly away from the optimum value. This means that often more physically complex models are less likely to yield different optimum parameter values when calibrated on different datasets resulting in a more robust numerical model. Lastly, the inclusion of bridge structures can simulate substantial local backwatering effects, but the variability in observed water and wrack marks is such that it is not possible to discern the effect of the bridges at this site in the post-event observational dataset.

abstract = {Cellular-based approaches for flood inundation modelling have been extensively calibrated and evaluated for this prediction of flood flows on rural river reaches. However, there has only been limited application of these approaches to urban environments, where the need for flood management is greatest. Practical application of two-dimensional (2D) flood inundation models is often limited by computation time and processing power on standard desktop PCs when attempting to resolve flows on the high-resolution grids necessary to replicate urban features. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of coarse grids to represent flood flows through urban environments. To examine these effects, LOSFLOOD-FP, a 2D storage cell model, is applied to hypothetical flooding scenarios in Greenfields, Glasgow, Grid resampling techniques in GIS software packages are evaluated and a bilinear griddling technique appears to provide the most accurate and physically intuitive results. A gridding method maintaining sharp elevation changes at building interfaces and neighbouring land is presented and estimates of the discretization noise associated with the coarse resolution grids suggest little improvement over current gridding methods. The variation in model results from the friction sensitivity analysis suggests a non-stationary response to Manning's n with changing model resolution. Model results suggests that a coarse resolution model for urban applications is limited by the representation or urban media in coarse model grids. Furthermore, critical length scales related to building dimensions and building separation distances exist in urban areas that determine maximum possible grid resolutions for hydraulic models of urban flooding.

In this paper implementation of the FVM including the Riemann solvers, slope limiters and methods used for achieving second order accuracy are described explicitly step by step. The performance of the numerical methods has been investigated by applying them to a number of examples from the literature, providing both comparison of the schemes with each other and with published results.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art high-resolution explicit scheme for the shallow water equations on graphics processing units. The selected scheme is well-balanced, supports dry states, and is particularly suitable for implementation on graphics processing units. We verify and validate our implementation, and show that use of efficient single precision hardware is sufficiently accurate for real-world simulations. Our framework further supports real-time visualization with both photorealistic and non-photorealistic display of the physical quantities. We present performance results showing that we can accurately simulate the first 4000 s of the Malpasset dam break case in 27 s using over 480,000 cells (dx=dy=15 m), in which our simulator runs at an average of 530 megacells per second. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An experimental study of the characteristics of dividing critical flows in a 90° open-channel junction formed by three horizontal equal-width branches is presented, conducted for various inflow discharges and downstream boundary conditions. Outflow discharges and flow depths were also measured. Four main flow patterns are identified considering the location and length of the hydraulic jumps that develop across the main and lateral channels. A relationship between the discharge division ratio and the tailwater Froude number is found, reproducing well the experimental data. Practical applications of this relationship include the design of open channel and pipe networks and one-dimensional numerical modelling of flood propagation in urban areas. The study shows also that a two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical model hardly gives better predictions of the discharge ratios because of the presence of three-dimensional features at the junction.},

@article{Weitzman2007,
abstract = {The Stern Review calls for immediate decisive action to stabilize greenhouse gases because "the benefits of strong, early action on climate chance outweighs the costs." The economic analysis supporting this conclusion consists mostly of two basic strands. The first strand is a formal aggregative model that relies for its conclusions primarily upon imposing a very low discount rate. Concerning this discount-rate aspect, I am skeptical of the Review's formal analysis, but this essay points out that we are actually a lot less sure about what interest rate should be used for discounting climate change than is commonly acknowledged. The Review's second basic strand is a more intuitive argument that it might be very important to avoid possibly large uncertainties that are difficult to quantify. Concerning this uncertainty aspect, I argue that it might be recast into sound analytical reasoning that might justify some of the Review's conclusions. The basic issue here is that spending money to slow global warming should perhaps not be conceptualized primarily as being about consumption smoothing as much as being about how much insurance to buy to offset the small change of a ruinous catastrophe that is difficult to compensate by ordinary savings.},

abstract = {Flood inundation modelling on urbanised floodplains has become more feasible due to the increased availability of high resolution digital terrain data and computer power. However, studies that validate simulations with spatially distributed measurements are rare, especially for large events. This paper reports one of the most comprehensive validation data sets available to date on an urban flood, collected in January 2005 after a major event in the city of Carlisle, UK. For the first time this case study collated distributed urban maximum water level and extent measurements with gauged hydrographs, LiDAR elevation data and digital Mastermap{\textregistered} data. These data were used to build and calibrate two 2D diffusion wave models at the whole city scale, based on digital elevation data with and without buildings. RMSE between measured and simulated maximum water level was 0.32 m and 0.28 m for the models with and without buildings, respectively, the latter being more accurate due to blockages on the floodplain when building heights were included in the topography. The magnitude of simulation errors compared well with other studies in the literature, and considering potential errors in the measurement data indicates that the diffusion wave approach was adequate to capture the first-order physics relevant here, although a global channel roughness parameter was unable to capture the full spatially-varying dynamics of the flood event. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Designing appropriate environmental and energy policies, in order to meet the Kyoto protocol's carbon dioxide (CO(2)) reduction targets in the European Union (EU), requires a detailed examination and thorough understanding of CO(2) emission trends across the EU member states. This paper investigates whether CO(2) emissions have converged across 22 European countries over the 1971 to 2006 period. The Bayesian shrinkage estimation method is employed to do this work and the results reveal the following: first, the hypothesis of absolute convergence in per capita CO(2) emissions is supported and a slight upward convergence is observed; second, the fact that countries differ considerably in both their speed of convergence and volatility in emissions makes it possible to identify different groups of countries; third, the results with respect to convergence do not vary much once the share of industry in GDP is accounted for in a conditional convergence analysis. However, a decreasing share of industry in GDP seems to contribute to a decline in per capita emissions. These findings may carry important implications for both national and EU environmental policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Flood risk studies require hydraulic modeling in order to estimate flow depths and other hydraulic variables in the floodplain for a wide range of input conditions. Currently there is a need to improve the computational efficiency of fully two-dimensional numerical models for large-scale flood simulation. This paper describes an adaptive quadtree grid-based shallow water equation solver and demon- strates its capability for flood inundation modeling. Due to the grid dynamically adapting to dominant flow features such as steep water surface gradients and wet-dry fronts, the approach is both efficient and accurate. The quadtree model is applied to a realistic scenario of flood inundation over an urban area of 36 km2, resulting from the flood defenses breaching at Thamesmead on the River Thames, United Kingdom. The results of the simulation are in close agreement with alternative predictions obtained using the commercially available software TUFLOW.},

@article{Kuo2011,
abstract = {Presented is a general method for conservation equations called SHLL (split HLL) applied using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration. The SHLL method is a purely vector-split approximation of the classical HLL method [Harten, Lax and van Leer, 1983] which assumes the presence of local wave propagation in the algabraic derivation of fluxes across cell surfaces. The conventional HLL flux expression terms are interface-split and wave propagation velocities estimated (where required) based on local conditions. Due to the highly local nature of the SHLL fluxes, the scheme is very efficiently applied to GPU computation since the flux, initialisation and update phases of the computation are all vectorized processes. The SHLL scheme is applied to GPU computating using Nvidia's CUDA package. Numerical schemes are presented for solutions to the general transport (convection- diffusion) equation, Euler Equations and Shallow Water Equations with results presented for several benchmark gas and shallow water flow engineering problems. Computational times are compared between high end GPU (Nvidia C1060) and CPU (Intel Xeon 3.0GHz, 32MB cache) systems with reported speedups of over 67 times when applied to two dimensional simulations with multi-million cell numbers.},

The selected scheme is well-balanced, supports dry states, and is particularly suitable for implementation on graphics processing units. We verify and validate our implementation, and show that use of efficient single precision hardware is sufficiently accurate for real-world simulations. Our framework further supports real-time visualization with both photorealistic and non-photorealistic display of the physical quantities. We present performance results showing that we can accurately simulate the first 4000 s of the Malpasset dam break case in 27 s using over 480,000 cells (dx=dy=15 m), in which our simulator runs at an average of 530 megacells per second. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using LTS, the solution in each cell is advanced with the largest power of two multiple of the global time step required for stability, $\delta$t, that satisfies the local criterion for stability.A careful sequencing of flux calculations and solution updates ensures conservation. Test problems including practical applications show that LTS achieves run?time reductions ranging from 50 to 70{\%} without loss of accuracy. In addition, a four level scheme that coordinates time steps of $\delta$t, 2$\delta$t, 4$\delta$t, and 8$\delta$t performs best in idealized and practical test problems considered for this study. Additional levels achieve no further reduction in run time, and in some cases cause instability and deteriorate conservation.},

@article{Tol2009,
abstract = {Using a simple model designed for transparency but nonetheless calibrated to support the much-quoted damage estimates of the Stem Review of the Economics of Climate Change, we demonstrate significant sensitivity of those results to assumptions about the pure rate of time preference, the time horizon, and the rates of risk and equity aversion used to compute certainty- and equity-equivalent annuities. Most importantly, we demonstrate enormous sensitivity to presumed constant regional vulnerability and underlying assumptions about adaptive capacity. Manipulation of any of these parameters one at a time across reasonable ranges can diminish damage estimates by as much as 84{\%} or, in the case of extending the time horizon with the Review's low discount rate, increase damage estimates by 900{\%}. We also confirm the usual result that limiting atmospheric concentrations to specific benchmarks above 400 ppm cannot eliminate all damages. Nonetheless, we applaud the Stem Review author team for reconfirming that the climate problem can be approached productively as an economic problem whose solutions can be explored with the tools of decision analysis.

@article{Bates2000,
abstract = {In this paper the development of a new model for simulating flood inundation is outlined. The model is designed to operate with high-resolution raster Digital Elevation Models, which are becoming increasingly available for many lowland floodplain rivers and is based on what we hypothesise to be the simplest possible process representation capable of simulating dynamic flood inundation. This consists of a one-dimensional kinematic wave approximation for channel flow solved using an explicit finite difference scheme and a two-dimensional diffusion wave representation of floodplain flow. The model is applied to a 35 km reach of the River Meuse in The Netherlands using only published data sources and used to simulate a large flood event that occurred in January 1995. This event was chosen as air photo and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for flood inundation extent are available to enable rigorous validation of the developed model. 100, 50 and 25 m resolution models were constructed and compared to two other inundation prediction techniques: a planar approximation to the free surface and a relatively coarse resolution two-dimensional finite element scheme. The model developed in this paper outperforms both the simpler and more complex process representations, with the best fit simulation correctly predicting 81.9{\%} of inundated and non-inundated areas. This compares with 69.5{\%} for the best fit planar surface and 63.8{\%} for the best fit finite element code. However, when applied solely to the 7 km of river below the upstream gauging station at Borgharen the planar model performs almost as well (83.7{\%} correct) as the raster model (85.5{\%} correct). This is due to the proximity of the gauge, which acts as a control point for construction of the planar surface and the fact that here low-lying areas of the floodplain are hydraulically connected to the channel. Importantly though it is impossible to generalise such application rules and thus we cannot specify a priori where the planar approximation will work. Simulations also indicate that, for this event at least, dynamic effects are relatively unimportant for prediction of peak inundation. Lastly, consideration of errors in typically available gauging station and inundation extent data shows the raster-based model to be close to the current prediction limit for this class of problem.
