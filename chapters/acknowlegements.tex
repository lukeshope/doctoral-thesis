I cannot offer enough gratitude to my primary supervisor, Qiuhua Liang, for planting the seed which led to many of the ideas explored in this thesis, and for his unwavering help and support throughout the last five years. I must also acknowledge Paul Quinn, whose assistance, lateral thinking, and inquisitive mind undoubtedly improved this work.

This thesis was examined by Slobodan Djordjevic and Caspar Hewett, and I am extremely appreciative of their contributions in time, expertise, and indispensable scrutiny.

This thesis might never have been realised, were it not for Greg O'Donnell, a true friend and a pleasure to work with, whose feedback was invaluable, and breadth of knowledge and experience indispensable.

I am incredibly fortunate to have benefited from the company of colleagues and peers, including Samantha Mahaffey, Jennine Jonczyk, Gareth Owen, Alex Nicholson, Nick Barber, Matt Perks, David Pearson, Neil Harris, Phil James, Tom Komar, Michael Pollock, and Stephen Blenkinsop.

This work would not have been possible without the funding and equipment received from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and Newcastle University.

Finally, I wish to thank my partner Gavin Hope, for his patience, encouragement, and understanding, throughout an often stressful pursuit.
